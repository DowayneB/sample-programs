In this article, we'll tackle getting DNS records.

## Description

DNS is the "phonebook" of the internet. Every hostname (google.com,www.google.com,mail.google.com), needs to correspond to an IP address.
This IP address is configured on a server, which uses NGINX/Apache/Microsoft-IIS to serve files for the given hostname.

This project will allow you to get different DNS records associated with a domain, which make both websites, and mail route correctly.
