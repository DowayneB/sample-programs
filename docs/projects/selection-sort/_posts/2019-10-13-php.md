In this article, we'll be tackling Selection Sort in PHP.

## How to Implement the Solution

The Selection sort algorithm is based on the idea of finding the minimum or maximum element in an unsorted array and then putting it in its correct position in a sorted array.


The minimum element in the array is searched for and then swapped with the element that is currently located at the first position.

### Solution

```php
<?php

$arr = array(1,10,2,4,3,7,6,9,0,8,5);

$noElements = count($arr);

for($count=0; $count <= $noElements; $count++)
{
    for($incremented=$count+1; $incremented<=$noElements; $incremented++)
    {
        if($arr[$count] > $arr[$incremented] )
        {
            //At this point, we have determined the smaller element, and are swapping out its value.
            $curIncrement = $arr[$incremented];
            $arr[$incremented] = $arr[$count];
            $arr[$count] = $curIncrement;
        }
    }

    echo $arr[$count].PHP_EOL;
}
